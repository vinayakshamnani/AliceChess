The ai module holds the AI logic required by the Alice Chess game.

The main AI module is the AliceAI.
It's provided through the AliceAI interface.

The base implementation is given by the BaseAliceAIImpl class.
This isn't hte final class. It's only a prototype that manages to send out all valid moves.

The AliceAIFactory class is the actual factory class that plugs in the implementation of the AliceAI api.
