This is a prototype of the alice chess program made by our team. 
This is v0.2.4 where the game is expected to do the following:
1. Reads the referee's first message from standard input.
2. Respond instantly if the program is white, else skips a turn.
3. Reads a message from standard input and prints it's message to the standard output.
4. Continues making valid moves until it receives a <win>, <lose> or a <draw> message.
5. Every move made is stateful in the sense, the game knows the current state of the game.
6. After a termination message, the program exits with a status 0.

This rapid prototype does not incorporate any smart strategy.
It only picks the first move from the list of valid moves until the program wins, loses or there is a draw.
It does however maintains a state of the game so it knows which moves are valid and which aren't.

The folder src contains the source code (Java files) required for this application.
the jar alice_v0.2.4.jar contains the final build for this prototype.
The script alice5500 is a simple script that invokes the java command to run the application.

Instructiosn to run the application:
1. Extract the .tar.gz file into the required folder using the command:
    tar -zxvf alice_chess_team3.tar.gz
2. Verify that the extracted file contains the following files:
   i)   README              - This file
   ii)  alice_v0.2.4.jar    - The jar containing the executable program
   iii) alice5500           - The script that runs the program
   iv)  src                 - Folder containing the source code for the application
2. Run the script ./alice5500 without any command line parameters.



Thank You.
